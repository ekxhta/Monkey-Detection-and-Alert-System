# Monkey Threat Detection - Machine Learning 

This repository contains the YOLOv8-based model implementation for the Monkey Threat Detection and Alert System.

The system detects monkeys in video footage and is trained using a custom dataset from Roboflow. Training and testing are done in Google Colab, with data stored in Google Drive.



### Objective

To automatically detect monkeys in surveillance video and generate alerts to prevent intrusion or disturbances in hostel or campus areas.



### ML Details

- **Model**: YOLOv8 (YOLOv8l)
- **Platform**: Google Colab
- **Dataset**: Roboflow (YOLOv8 format)
- **Trained Weights**: `best.pt` stored on Google Drive
